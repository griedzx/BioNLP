       "   'abstract': 'OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate the current status and the influence factors of exercise, and to explore the impact of exercise on the quality of life (QoL) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in the post-COVID-19 period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Those PD patients who were followed up between September 2020 and August 2021 were enrolled. The collected data included demographic information, clinical data, exercise data, and QoL. RESULTS: In total, 339 PD patients were included in this cross-sectional study. The mean age was 44.0 +- 13.0 years, with a median PD duration of 6.7 (1.7 - 41.9) months. The primary renal disease was glomerulonephritis (68.4%). 277 (81.7%) PD patients performed exercise, with median exercise time 5.0 (3.5 - 7.8) hours per week. The main type of exercise was slow walking. Pain (odds ratio (OR) = 0.311, p = 0.002) and lower hemoglobin level (OR = 1.016, p = 0.033) were independent risk factors for exercise. Moreover, male sex (B = 2.803, p < 0.001) was an independent protective factor, while advanced age (B = -0.097, p < 0.001), higher body mass index (B = -0.154, p < 0.001), and pain (B = -0.643, p = 0.023) were independent risk factors for exercise intensity. After adjustment for other confounders, exercise (B = 5.787, p = 0.037) was an independent protective factor for total score of QoL in PD patients. CONCLUSION: In the current study, 81.7% of PD patients performed exercise in the post-COVID-19 period. Pain and anemia were independent risk factors for exercise in PD patients. Advanced age, female sex, higher body mass index, and pain were independently associated with lower exercise capacity in PD patients. PD patients undergoing exercise had better QoL.'}),\n",

We conducted a prospective study with 26 COVID-19 patients with haematological malignancies to determine viral shedding kinetics and characteristics. We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from the patients 21-28 days post-onset for a PCR test and performed virus isolation from the PCR-positive samples. A viable virus was detected in five patients (19.2%), all of whom had malignant lymphoma. Those patients had significantly lower CD4+ T-cell counts than the PCR-negative patients. A comparison of previous chemotherapy showed that anti-CD20 antibodies and bendamustine may be risk factors for prolonged viral shedding.'})]"

Symptom persistence (pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia, sleep disturbance, and neurological symptoms) and patients' physical levels of functioning were recorded. Symptoms improved in many patients after acute COVID-19 (n = 73, 51.4%). Still, a high percentage of patients had complaints, and women were affected more often. In many patients, ongoing immune activation (as indicated by high neopterin and CRP concentrations) and enhanced tryptophan catabolism were found. A higher phenylalanine to tyrosine ratio (Phe/Tyr) was found in women with a lower level of functioning. Patients who reported improvements in pain had lower Phe/Tyr ratios, while patients with improved gastrointestinal symptoms presented with higher tryptophan and kynurenine values. Our results suggest that women have persistent symptoms after COVID-19 more often than men. In addition, the physical level of functioning and the improvements in certain symptoms appear to be associated with immune-mediated changes in amino acid metabolism.\n"

      "After COVID-19, patients have reported various complaints such as fatigue, neurological symptoms, and insomnia. Immune-mediated changes in amino acid metabolism might contribute to the development of these symptoms. Patients who had had acute, PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection about 60 days earlier were recruited within the scope of the prospective CovILD study. We determined the inflammatory parameters and alterations in tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism in 142 patients cross-sectionally. Symptom persistence (pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia, sleep disturbance, and neurological symptoms) and patients' physical levels of functioning were recorded. Symptoms improved in many patients after acute COVID-19 (n = 73, 51.4%). Still, a high percentage of patients had complaints, and women were affected more often. In many patients, ongoing immune activation (as indicated by high neopterin and CRP concentrations) and enhanced tryptophan catabolism were found.
