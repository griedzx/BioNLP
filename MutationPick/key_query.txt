This phenomenon, termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID, is associated with high viral titers during acute infection, a persistently hyperactivated immune system, tissue injury by NETosis-induced micro-thrombofibrosis (NETinjury), microbial translocation, complement deposition, fibrotic macrophages, the presence of autoantibodies, and lymphopenic immune environments.
